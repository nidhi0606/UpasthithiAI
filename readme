With over 10 years of experience, UpasthithiAI is a cutting-edge SaaS solution for Absence Mitigation, Workflow Automation, and Workforce Reinforcement, 
specifically designed to help organizations with hourly work forces meet their production goals. 
The key differentiator between our product and other Absence Management and Attendance Tracking Workforce Management (WFM) tools in the market is 
that our software is not just a data repository. 
While typical Absence Management and Attendance Tracking systems store data, our solution actively reduces workforce shrinkage, employee attrition, 
and the time HR and Operations teams spend managing absence-related tasks. 
Additionally, our software automates the process of filling roles left vacant due to absences. 
Simply put, we don't just track absences, we solve for them.
